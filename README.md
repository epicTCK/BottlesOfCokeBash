# BottlesOfCokeBash
99 bottles of beer (coke) in bash. This version only works on mac OS X. Great for pranks!   
run `chmod a+x pathToFile` to make executable.  
to run the program, type  
`./pathToFile`  
To make a command for this, run  
`nano ~/.bash_profile`  
then add 
`alias coke = './pathTo_BottlesOfCoke.sh'`  

now type `coke` in the terminal and hit enter.  
Even funnier, go into automator and make it so that it runs everytime a folder is opened!
